# JavaScript Suggestion System

This project implements a dynamic suggestion system using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. As the user types into the input field, relevant suggestions appear from a predefined list. Selecting a suggestion will automatically populate the input field.

## Features

- **Real-time Suggestions:** Offers suggestions dynamically as the user types.
- **Interactive Selection:** Clicking on suggestions populates the input box.
- **Simple Design:** Clean and responsive UI for an enhanced user experience.

## Project Structure

```
project-root/
├── index.html          # Main HTML structure
├── script.js           # JavaScript logic
├── README.md           # Documentation
```

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone or download the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ordnarycoder/Suggestion-System-49.git
```

2. **Open `index.html` in your web browser** (no setup required).

## How It Works

- **HTML** provides the structure with an input field and a container for suggestions.
- **CSS** handles the basic styling and positioning.
- **JavaScript** dynamically generates suggestions based on user input, handling filtering and user interaction events.

## Customization

To customize the suggestion list, modify the array inside `script.js`:

```javascript
const suggestions = [
  'apple',
  'banana',
  'orange',
  // Add your items here
];
```

## Future Improvements

- Integrate with external APIs for dynamic suggestion generation.
- Improve styling and responsiveness.
- Add keyboard navigation for suggestions.
